## 🚀 About Me

<p>
I am a learner of the ALX <strong>Software Engineering</strong> program, and I’m currently focused on becoming a proficient Front-End Developer. I’m revamping my GitHub profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search.
</p>

<p>
I started with software engineering because I’m fascinated by how digital solutions can transform lives and connect the world. My journey began with curiosity and a deep desire to be part of the global tech transformation, especially for underserved communities.
</p>

<p>
I’m passionate about <strong>user-centered design, building inclusive web interfaces, and solving real-world problems</strong> through technology. I draw inspiration from the impact tech has on education, access to information, and the empowerment of youth and women across Africa.
</p>

<p>
My aim is to <strong>use technology to build scalable, human-centered solutions that address real societal needs</strong>. That’s why I’m interested in working on projects related to:
</p>

- Educational platforms  
- Accessibility and inclusion  
- Cultural preservation  
- Community empowerment  
- Data-driven tools for development
